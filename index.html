                    <p>M Foundation has been set up a group of ten friends, all alumnus of Malnad college of Engineering (MCE), Hassan, Karnataka, India.</p>

                    <p>The idea and plan of action for M Foundation was hatched at a dinner table over a few cocktails in 2006. The original plan was to set up a corpus and invest it so that interest gained from the corpus would be used to provide a scholarship to meritorious, but economically disadvantaged students in MCE. The initial plan was one male and one female student from each year. This plan was communicated to all like-minded friends. Finally 10 of us got together and M Foundation was formally and legally set up in early 2007. Although originally the plan had been to help students in only in MCE, the trustees felt that we should do more and give financial aid to other truly deserving individuals and organizations.</p>

                    <p>By September 2007 we had already given our first scholarship to an individual, in November we aided a school in Kushalnagar (Kodogu) and in December 2007 we gave the M Foundation scholarships to the first batch of students in MCE. Over the years we have added to our activities in MCE by initiating a cash award to STUDENT OF THE YEAR and also introducing scholarships to children of Class IV employees of the our alma-mater. On the activities outside of MCE, we have increased our reach and have sponsored/aided many deserving individuals and institutions. As of February 2017 we have disbursed over 55 lakh Rupees to different individuals and institutions.</p>
