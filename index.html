                    <p>M Foundation has been set up a group of ten friends, all alumnus of Malnad college of Engineering (MCE), Hassan, Karnataka, India.</p>

                    <p>The idea and plan of action for M Foundation was hatched over dinner in 2006. The original plan was to set up a corpus and invest it so that interest gained from the corpus would be used to provide a scholarship to meritorious, but economically disadvantaged students in MCE. The initial plan was one male and one female student from each year. This plan was communicated to all like-minded friends. Finally 10 of us got together and M Foundation was formally and legally set up in early 2007. Although originally the plan had been to help students in only in MCE, the trustees felt that we should do more and give financial aid to other truly deserving individuals and organizations.</p>

                    <p>By September 2007 we had already given our first scholarship to an individual, in November we aided a school in Kushalnagar (Kodogu) and in December 2007 we gave the M Foundation scholarships to the first batch of students in MCE. Over the years we have added to our activities in MCE by initiating a cash award to STUDENT OF THE YEAR and also introducing scholarships to children of Class IV employees of the our alma-mater. On the activities outside of MCE, we have increased our reach and have sponsored/aided many deserving individuals and institutions. As of February 2017 we have disbursed over 55 lakh Rupees to different individuals and institutions.</p>

                    <p>Pursuing engineering in a reputed college was my dream. As I was from a middle class family, and since my parents had several other commitments, arranging finance for my studies (engineering in good college) was a worry. At the end of my Diploma I got to know about M Foundation and I got more motivated to work still harder to secure a seat in my dream college as I received assurance of financial support from M Foundation. My parents did not have to worry for arranging college fees for their son now. I could fully focus on my studies and career as I dint have the burden of arranging finance. I did multiple projects, attended few conferences and received job offers from two companies with appreciable package.</br>
                    Yes. I would not have accomplished all these without the M Foundation support!. I am ever grateful for your help.  They doing a great job by helping less privileged students like me to make their dream come true. 
                    Thank you very much</br>
                    Now I am working in M/S. Atlas Copco as design engineer (from July 16)</p>

                    <p>I am very thankful to M Foundation and Jayantha sir.<br>
                    As I was from rural background and my family was economical backward, M Foundation scholarship has helped me a lot in buying books, study materials and paying room rents while I was studying. It would have been difficult to my family to support my education without this scholarship.<br>
                    I am very happy to share with you that, even before my graduation I had two offers in my hand, 1 from SPAN InfoTech Bangalore(2.5 Lpa) and 1 from Tejas Networks Bangalore(5.5 Lpa). <br>
                    From my graduation till today I am working in Tejas Networks Company in product verification team. I am very happy with my position in company and also able to support my family economically.</p>
